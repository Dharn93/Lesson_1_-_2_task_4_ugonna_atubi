    <h1 name="top">Links and Anchors</h1> 
    <p>
        In this section, I will be practising how to use the link and anchor tags in our html documents.
        its a well known fact that the link and anchor tags are used to create a link to our documents/webpages. These links can be internal ( switches between pages on your website )
or external links to other sites.
In a more simplified form, the anchor element, witg its href attribute creates a hyperlink
to web pages or a link to anything else that can be represented in a  a URL. To understand the anchor tags
 fully, I wil recommend you to the following sites where an indebt/detailed explanation has been dropped.
 This <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/html-anchor/">link </a> gives you a very good decriptionm and usage of the anchor links. also additional informations can be 
 found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">here</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-html-a-tag-anchor-tag-example-code/">here</a>.

        <h2>More Explanation </h2>
        <p>The anchor tag, also known as the hyperlink tag, is used in HTML to create links to other web pages,
             files, or locations within the same web page. The anchor tag is represented by the
            ( <code> <a> </code> tag) in HTML, and it requires an href attribute to specify the URL or location of the linked resource.

            Here's a breakdown of the different parts of the anchor tag:
            
            The <a> opening tag: This is the start of the anchor tag.
            
            The href attribute: This attribute is required and specifies the URL or location of the linked resource. It can be an absolute URL, such as "https://www.example.com", or a relative URL, such as "/about.html". If the linked resource is an email address, the href attribute should start with "mailto:".
            
            The link text: This is the visible text that the user clicks on to follow the link. It's placed between the opening and closing <a> tags, like this: <a href="https://www.example.com">Link text</a>.
            
            The <a> closing tag: This is the end of the anchor tag.</p>

<h3> Difference Between a link and an Anchor</h3>
<p>A link is the traversable connection between two nodes. An anchor is the visible region which must be selected to activate the link. These may vary in size from one word to the entire contents of the node. For example, in this current node, the word "nodes" in the first sentence is an anchor. It is the visible part of a link between the nodes "Links and Anchors" and "Node." In theory, anchors may overlap; in practice, most systems insist on their being distinct, in order to make the underlying mechanics simpler.

    The granularity of link destinations is an important qualifier. Some systems support only basic links, eg. those which connect two nodes without specific anchors. Source anchors are available in almost all hypertext systems. Destination anchors allow a particular region of a node to be addressed; this becomes the focus when the link is traversed. For multi-screen nodes, this is a helpful feature. However, destination anchors are supported in only some hypertext systems. More often, the entire destination node is referenced, and the reader is placed at the beginning of the text. This may result in disorientation, particularily if more than a screenful of text must be traversed before the passage relevant to the link is discovered</p>
